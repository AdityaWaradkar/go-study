# Go Study

An evolving technical resource documenting my daily progress in mastering the Go ecosystem and computer science fundamentals. This repository follows a dual-track curriculum, simultaneously covering backend engineering from foundations to cloud-native systems and the rigorous implementation of data structures and algorithms.

## Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for:
- **Backend Engineering:** Building scalable, observable, and secure services.
- **Computer Science:** Implementing efficient algorithms and data structures in idiomatic Go.
- **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Mastering containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Curriculum Tracks

### Track A: Backend Engineering and Systems
1. **Foundations:** Syntax, concurrency primitives, and memory management.
2. **Backend Services:** net/http, middleware, authentication (JWT), and SQL integration.
3. **Architecture:** System design, gRPC, and modular monoliths.
4. **Cloud Native:** Docker, Kubernetes, and Observability (Prometheus/Grafana).

### Track B: Data Structures and Algorithms
1. **Complexity:** Big-O analysis and mathematical foundations.
2. **Linear Structures:** Arrays, Slices, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
3. **Non-Linear Structures:** Trees, Heaps, and Graphs.
4. **Algorithmic Patterns:** Sorting, Searching, Sliding Window, and Dynamic Programming.
